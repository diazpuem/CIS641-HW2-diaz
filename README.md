## Marcos Diaz
- I am a software developer in a company that develops a video game, I honestly don't enjoy playing it anymore. 
- I love the world of music and I have been playing the bass guitar for about 10 years. I'm not that good but it's honest work.
- I would like to learn a little more about programming microprocessors like arduino and similar. I promised to learn it during pandemic time but I couldn't.

### Technical Background
I'm Backend Developer with over 7 years of experience working with teams over industries such as Games, Delivery, E-commerce, Health and Insurance. My main technologies are Java, Kotlin, Spring Boot and lately I have been working with technologies such as PHP and lua.
